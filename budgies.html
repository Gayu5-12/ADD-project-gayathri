<p>Lovable pets because they are easy to keep and are not expensive.<br><br>
Can be kept together in small flocks.<br><br>

It is easier for pets to keep as they are pretty low-maintenance and require only simple food options to thrive.<br><br>
Small-sized birds that generally do not grow beyond 7-8 inches.<br><br>
Intelligent birds with different personalities<br><br>
