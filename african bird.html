<p>The African grey parrot is one of the world's most talented talking/imitating birds, earning a loyal following among bird enthusiasts. Not only do bird keepers adore this intelligent bird, but it's also one of the most well-known species among bird newbies â€” everyone recognizes the African grey parrot. This parrot is one of the oldest psittacine species kept by humans, with records dating back to the era. This parrot's popularity is due to its understated beauty and a brilliant, no-nonsense attitude.
<br><br>
The skill of the African grey parrot to talk and mimic sounds makes it a mesmerizing companion. African grey owners report that their grays speak in a sense and are aware of their owners' emotions. The African grey parrot is not only a great talker, but it also has a high level of intelligence.
<br><br>
The African grey appears to be a medium-sized, dusty grey bird. And it looks almost pigeon-like at first glance, but closer inspection reveals a bright red tail, intelligent orange eyes, and a stunning scalloped pattern to its plumage
