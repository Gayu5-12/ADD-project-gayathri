<p>Are you aware that lovebirds are parrots? Yes, they are parrots, though relatively small ones
<br><br>
They are members of the Psittaciformes order, which includes all parrots. Their bill is hooked, and their feet are zygodactyl (two toes point forward and two-point backward).
<br><br>
A lovebird is one of the smaller parrot species available as a pet, but this bird is curious and always moving.
<br><br>
Lovebirds are known for the loving, attentive bond they form with their partners, as their name suggests.
